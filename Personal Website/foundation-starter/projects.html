                        This was a project from CISC 340 using MIPS where I made a program to add up the numbers in an array and average it.
                        While this project wouldn't have been hard in a language like java or python.
                        MIPS is a processor for Assembly which is a very tedious coding langauge and takes a lot more code to do a simple task that would generally by considered easy.

                        Two summers ago I had an Computer Science intership at Mayo Clinic. One of the most interesting parts of my internship was attending a conference in Rochester as my intership was online.
                        I got to meet a ton of startups that are using AI to revolutionize different parts of the healthcare industry. It was super interesting to hear them talk about how they are using AI.
                        I also got to attend plenty of other breakout sessions with expert panels. One of the startups I spent a lot of time around was a company called Cliexa which is tackling opioid risk prediction using AI.
                        Unfortunately all my work was done on a company issued computer so I do not have pictures of what I worked on. 
                        So here is a picture from the conference.

                        This past semester I took CISC 350 and this was an assignment to check some encrypted passwords 
                        The p1hashes file contained some passwords that were encrypted and converted to hex. 
                        I then took the 10 million most common passwords and encrypted them in the same way as p1hashes was.
                        I then converted it to hex and checked to see if they matched any of the passwords on p1hashes.

                        This was a project from CISC 230 where I made a program to solve Futoshiki puzzles.
                        In this assignment I used the ForkJoinPool to break down the computational intensive task into smaller tasks that are more easily solved.
                        This allowed me to solve the puzzle much faster than just brute forcing through the whole puzzle which is very inefficient.
